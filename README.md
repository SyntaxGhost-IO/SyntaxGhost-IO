# Hi, I am SytaxGhost-IO 👻

# 🚀 The Mission: Future Blockchain Data Scientist
I am a **Data Science student** currently mastering the fundamentals of data analysis. My goal is to apply these analytical skills to decentralized ledgers and blockchain ecosystems. I am also fascinated by **Neuroscience** and how biological intelligence can inform digital network structures.

📊 **Current Focus:** Learning Python and Statistics for Data Science.
⛓️ **The Path:** Transitioning into Blockchain analytics (on-chain data).
🧠 **Secondary Interest:** Exploring Computational Neuroscience.

# 🛠️ Current Learning Stack
**Data Science (Active):** Python (Pandas, NumPy), Probability and Statistics, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics.
**Environments:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
**Blockchain (Theory Phase):** Learning how ledgers work and decentralized structures.
**Tools:** Git/GitHub, VS Code

# 🎯 2026 Goals
 Master Python for Data Analysis.
 Understand the architecture of a Blockchain (Nodes, Blocks, and Hash).
 Connect my first dataset to a visualization tool.
